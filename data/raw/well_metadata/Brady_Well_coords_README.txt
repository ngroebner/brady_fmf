Brady_Well_coordinates_Metadata.csv information 

Background information
------------------------
Source data for x/y locations used includes Bradys_Master_Porotomo_2015-1-13.xlsx provided by ORMAT as well as coordinates measured by Neal Lord on 3/24/2016 using RTK GPS (points160324ll_wells.txt). When available, RTK coordinates were used. Otherwise, data from ORMAT was used.

Land surface elevations are given as m above WGS84 ellipsoid. If data from ORMAT was used, m above WGS84 ellipsoid was estimated based on data given by ORMAT (which was m above geoid), using an approximate offset (subtraction) of 24.43m to obtain m above ellipsoid

All elevations of open intervals in wells are computed based on data from original ORMAT spreadsheet. Information used was:
1) Elevation of land surface as described above
2) KB elevation above ground level as given in Bradys_Master_Porotomo_2015-1-13.xlsx
3) Measured depths of intervals below KB as given in Bradys_Master_Porotomo_2015-1-13.xlsx
4) All values are truncated at cm digit.

Total vertical depths of wells were given by ORMAT (Bradys_Master_Porotomo_2015-1-13.xlsx). However, only Measured Depth field was used in calculations.
